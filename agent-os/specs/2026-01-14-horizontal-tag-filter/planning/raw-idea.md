# Raw Idea

**Feature: Horizontal Tag Filter with All Tags**

The user wants to replace the current preset filter chips (All, Favorites, Quick, Healthy) with a horizontal scrollable list showing ALL tags from their recipes. This will allow users to filter recipes by any tag they have in their collection, using a horizontal scroll effect.

Currently there are only 4 hardcoded preset filters. The new feature should:
- Display all unique tags from the user's recipes
- Show them in a horizontal scrollable row
- Allow filtering recipes by selecting a tag
- Include an "All" option to show all recipes
